# ---- global planner ----
NavfnROS:

 # Specifies whether or not to allow navfn to create plans that traverse unknown space.
 # NOTE: if you are using a layered costmap_2d costmap with a voxel or obstacle layer, you
 # must also set the track_unknown_space param for that layer to be true, or it will convert
 # all your unknown space to free space (which navfn will then happily go right through). 
 allow_unknown: false


 # Specifies whether or not to visualize the potential area computed by navfn via a PointCloud2.
 visualize_potential: false

 # Default

 # Size of an optional window to restrict NavFn to work in a small window of a large costmap. 
 # planner_window_x: 0.0
 # planner_window_y: 0.0

 # Tolerance on the goal point for the planner.
