GlobalPlanner:

 # Specifies whether or not to allow the planner to create plans that traverse unknown space.
 # NOTE: if you are using a layered costmap_2d costmap with a voxel or obstacle layer, you
 # must also set the track_unknown_space param for that layer to be true, or it will convert
 # all your unknown space to free space (which planner will then happily go right through).

 # Specifies whether or not to visualize the potential area computed by navfn via a PointCloud2.

 # use dijkstra's (true) or A* (false) algorithm.

 # If true, use the quadratic approximation of the potential. Otherwise, use a simpler calculation.

 # If true, create a path that follows the grid boundaries. Otherwise, use a gradient descent method.

 # If for some reason, you want global_planner to exactly mirror the behavior of navfn, set
 # this to true (and use the defaults for the other boolean parameters)
